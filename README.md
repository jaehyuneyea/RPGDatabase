# Jae Hyune Yea Personal Project

## A turn-based RPG Game

*Project Proposal*
- ***What will the application do?<br>***
<br>
I'm picturing this application to be a RPG style game that tackles aspects of <br>
inventory, somewhat of a complex relationship with characters within the game, and
a story that is choice-driven by the user with alternate endings. <br>
<br>


- ***Who will use it?*** <br>
<br>
The main audience that I intend for this to be targeted towards are people who are just
looking for a fun game to play, pass time and have interest in the RPG genre. <br>
<br>

- ***Why is this project of interest to you?*** <br>
<br>
I find this project interesting because I see games as something that I can insert my own style
of humour, art, and writing skills into to ultimately tell show the user who I am as a person. 
I've always had an interest in game design, and just thinking of features that your game might
have and putting that into motion and adding the little by little to bring life to your creation is
something incredibly exciting to me.
